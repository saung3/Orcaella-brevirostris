## Dataset Summary
This dataset compromises of 4 alleles of MHCIIDQB in Irrawaddy dolphin with base pair length of 268bp. These sequences have been cleaned to display whole exon 2 of the DQB locus. 

## Data Format 
All the data are DNA sequences in standard FASTA files. 

## Curation Rationale
Previous research has found only one version of DQB allele using just one individual (Hayashi et al. 2003). Using a larger sample size increases the likelihood of detecting more MHCIIDQB alleles that has not been detected in a smaller sample size. Investigating multiple populations across the habitat range aids in assessing the difference in genetic variation between populations. More importantly, the findings will hint the immune health of the Irrawaddy dolphin across its subpopulation.

## Data Collection 
These data were collected by many research groups including locals from Thailand, postdoctoral researchers,graduate students are were also collected from several museums including the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) in Klaeng, Rayong , Thailand (n=11), the MareCet Research Organization (MereCet) in Selangor, Malaysia (n=2). We also obtained tissue sample from various sources including the Southwest Fisheries Science Center’s (SWFSC) Marine Mammal and Turtle Molecular Research Tissue Sample Collection (MMASTR) in La Jolla, CA, USA (n=29), the DMCR (n=11), and the MareCet (n=6). Since the species is under the risk of extinction, we obtained historic samples originally collected between 1875-1972 which are the osteological samples (n=16) and bone samples from Orcaella hinshohn (n=2) stored in eight
museum collections in the United States and Europe. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain modern samples in regions such as Sumatra (Indonesia), Ayeyarwaddy River (Myanmar), Chilika Lake (India), and the northern coast of Borneo.
